3. Go back to the Home Page


It’s a collection of 2 bite-sized tools designed to solve everyday money problems in seconds:

✨ Product Page - Show the All Product 
👨‍💻 Product Details Page - Show the Information about the Products
 
🧰 Tech Stack:
 HTML5 | PicoCSS | JavaScript | Routes | AtomRouter
Each tool has its own page. It was a great learning experience intially but now is easy to make their project by own and also improve the logical understanding.

This project was built as a learning milestone in neoG Camp, and I’m incredibly grateful for the mentorship and guidance of Ankita Tripathi🙌. Thank you for helping me level up!

It's a reminder that even small, simple tools can solve real-life problems. Try making something useful and have fun doing it!
